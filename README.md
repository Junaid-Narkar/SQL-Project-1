# SQL-Project-1

This SQL project enhances ABC Fashion's Sales Order Processing System, which supports a vast customer base and dedicated sales team. 

The project includes inserting new records into the Orders table and applying constraints (primary key, default, foreign key, and NOT NULL) to ensure data integrity across Salesman and Customer tables. 

It retrieves specific customer data, uses SET operators to find unique and duplicate SalesmanId values, and queries matching Orderdate, Salesman Name, Customer Name, Commission, and City for purchase amounts between 500 and 1500. 

A right join fetches comprehensive results from Salesman and Orders tables.
